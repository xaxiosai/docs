Pump Guard is a modular, real-time analysis pipeline built for Solana’s throughput. It ingests holder sets, wallet ages, native SOL balances, token balances, and price/liquidity via high‑RPS RPC and gRPC streams, then computes transparent risk metrics.

## Components

- Frontend: token lookup, shareable risk reports, per‑metric breakdowns
- Backend: ingestion/indexing, batched RPC, queues/rate limits, scoring
- Infra: high‑RPS RPC, Yellowstone/Laserstream gRPC, caching and snapshot storage
- Engine: metric registry, 0–100 normalization, weighted aggregate score

## Behavior Under Load

- High‑RPS RPC → low latency
- If constrained: queue + rate limit → slower but correct (no data loss)
- Caching: LRU + snapshots for fast reads and historical diffs

## Notes

- Current release is a DEMO due to limited infra/time; open-source by design
- Cloning with high‑RPS RPC + Yellowstone/Laserstream + solid indexing/caching enables stronger metrics
- Rug Checker v4 (closed-source) will extend Pump Guard with industrial features

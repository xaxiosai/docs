---

In the fast-moving world of Web3 and DeFi, hundreds of new tokens are launched every day.  
On **Solana**, platforms like **pump.fun** have revolutionized decentralized trading by letting anyone create and trade tokens in minutes.  

However, this open and permissionless design has also created a new wave of threats — **rug pulls** and **farming manipulation schemes** — that exploit social hype and liquidity patterns to deceive traders.

**Pump Guard** was born out of a simple question:  
*How can we protect traders and builders from hidden manipulation without limiting innovation?*

Pump Guard is an **open-source security layer** designed to detect scam-like behaviors, analyze wallet and liquidity patterns, and generate a **risk-based transparency score** for any token on pump.fun.  

Instead of predicting price movements, Pump Guard focuses on **data-driven safety**, helping traders, investors, and developers better understand what happens *behind the chart.*

Beyond being just an analytic tool, Pump Guard aims to bring accountability to the meme‑coin and community‑driven ecosystems — empowering honest projects to stand out while exposing exploitative ones.

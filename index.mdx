---

Every day, hundreds of new tokens launch on Solana's **pump.fun** platform. Anyone can create a token in minutes and start trading instantly.

This open design has unlocked incredible innovation â€” but it's also created new risks. **Rug pulls** and **farming manipulation** schemes exploit social hype to trap unsuspecting traders.

**Pump Guard** was built to solve one problem:

> How can we protect traders from hidden manipulation without killing innovation?

## What We Do

Pump Guard is a **free, open-source tool** that analyzes any pump.fun token and shows you the risk signals others miss.

We don't predict prices. We show you **what's happening behind the chart**:

- Are the top holders real traders or fresh bot wallets?
- Do they have SOL for trading, or did they drain everything?
- Is this an organic community or coordinated manipulation?

Every token gets a simple **0-100 risk score** based on blockchain data, not guesses.

## Who It's For

- **Traders**: Avoid scams before you buy
- **Communities**: Prove your token is legitimate
- **Developers**: Build trust with transparent metrics

## Try It Now

Visit [pumpguard.xaxios.com](https://pumpguard.xaxios.com) and paste any Solana token address. You'll get an instant risk report showing:

- Overall risk score and level
- Top holder analysis
- Fresh wallet detection
- Zero-SOL holder count

## Open Source

Everything is public on [GitHub](https://github.com/xaxios/pump-guard-monorepo). You can verify our code, run your own instance, or contribute improvements.

Our mission is simple: **bring transparency to meme coins and help honest projects succeed**.

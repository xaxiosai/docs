pump.fun has become one of the most active gateways for token creation and early liquidity on Solana, introducing a massive flow of first‑time DEX users and experimental tokens.

## Why Now

- Explosive token creation velocity on Solana
- Retail-driven liquidity cycles with minimal curation
- Social-first discovery funnels that are easy to game
- Infrastructure maturity (RPC/gRPC/indexing) enabling real-time analytics

## Addressable Market

- Daily new token launches: high hundreds to tens of thousands during peaks
- Only a fraction successfully migrate/liquidity‑bootstrap; many fail due to scams or poor fundamentals
- A large subset of migrated tokens still exhibit risky on-chain patterns (fresh wallets, clustering, zero-SOL holders)

This creates sustained demand for a transparent, low-friction safety layer that can be used pre-entry (due diligence) and post-entry (ongoing monitoring).

## Target Users

- Traders and investors seeking early-stage exposure on Solana
- Influencers, community leaders, and curators who need reputational safeguards
- Builders/teams who want to prove healthy token mechanics and holder quality
- Launchpads/DEXs and analytics platforms that need a fraud‑resistant signal layer

## Business Impact

- Freemium analytics for broad access
- Premium features for pro users, creators, and platforms (alerts, API, historical backtests)
- Open-source core fosters trust and community extensions while enabling a sustainable premium tier

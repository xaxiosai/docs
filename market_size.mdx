pump.fun is one of the largest token on‑ramps on Solana, funneling massive retail flow into early‑stage tokens. High launch velocity plus low curation creates structural demand for transparent risk signals.

## Why Now

- Token launch velocity is extreme: studies show ~10,000+ new tokens per 24h on pump.fun during peaks, with very high churn (most die fast).
- Daily activity regularly reaches hundreds of millions in volume and has peaked near ~$1B/day in surges, putting pump.fun at the center of retail flows.
- Graduation/migration efficiency is low: on certain days, <1% of launches migrate successfully; many migrated tokens still show risky on‑chain patterns.
- Launchpad market remains large even in slowdowns: ~100 tokens graduate daily across platforms with ~$100M daily graduation volume; pump.fun often holds ~95% share.

## Addressable Market

- Daily launches: high thousands to tens of thousands at peak cycles.
- Daily migrated tokens: ~100 across launchpads (pump.fun dominating c. 95%).
- Daily volumes: commonly >$90M; periodic spikes toward ~$1B.
- User base: DAUs have shown multi‑fold growth waves

This translates into continuous need for pre‑trade due diligence and post‑entry monitoring that is fast, unbiased, and source‑verifiable.

## Target Users

- Traders/investors seeking early Solana exposure with clear, auditable risk context
- Influencers/curators needing reputational safeguards before amplification
- Builders proving healthy holder quality and liquidity mechanics to stand out
- Launchpads/DEXs/analytics platforms integrating fraud‑resistant signal layers

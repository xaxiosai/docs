Pump Guard gives you **instant transparency** into any pump.fun token by analyzing blockchain data that scammers can't fake.

## What We Analyze

When you scan a token on [pumpguard.xaxios.com](https://pumpguard.xaxios.com), we check:

- **Top 50 holders**: Who owns the token?
- **Wallet ages**: Are they fresh wallets or established traders?
- **SOL balances**: Do holders have funds for trading, or zero balance (bot wallets)?
- **Distribution patterns**: Is ownership organic or clustered?

Every metric gets scored 0-100, then combined into one overall risk score.

## Our Principles

**Open Source First** All our code is public. You can verify exactly how we calculate risk.

**No Price Predictions** We show manipulation patterns, not investment advice.

**Real-Time Analysis** Scores calculated fresh when you scan, using live blockchain data.

**Built for Builders** Honest projects can prove legitimacy with transparent metrics.

## Who Benefits

**Traders** See red flags before you buy. Avoid rug pulls and farming scams.

**Communities** Prove your token is legitimate with on-chain data, not just promises.

**Builders** Stand out from scams by showing healthy holder patterns.

**Platforms** Reduce scam noise and keep users safe.

## Real Impact

**Without Pump Guard:** Scam bots pump tokens to millions in market cap, generate hype, then crash to zero overnight.

**With Pump Guard:** You see the warning signs early — fresh wallets, zero-SOL holders, suspicious patterns — and can make informed decisions.

## The Result

Instead of getting rugged, traders can:

- Spot manipulation before it's too late
- Support legitimate projects with confidence
- Help build a safer Solana ecosystem

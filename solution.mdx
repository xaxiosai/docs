---

Pump Guard provides a transparent, data-driven layer that helps traders, investors, and builders distinguish between organic communities and engineered manipulation.

## What Pump Guard Does

- Analyzes top holder composition, wallet age, native SOL balances, and token flow
- Scores tokens with a risk-based model (per-metric and aggregate)
- Surfaces red flags (e.g., fresh wallet concentration, zero-SOL wallets, suspicious clustering)
- Presents simple, actionable reports without giving investment advice

> Pump Guard does not say a token will go up or down.\
> It reveals risk and integrity signals behind the chart.

## Key Principles

- Open source first: community-auditable logic and extendable metrics
- Real-time where infrastructure allows; graceful degradation with queues and limits
- Builder-friendly: empowers honest teams to stand out
- Neutral: avoids price predictions, focuses on transparency

## Value to the Ecosystem

- Traders: avoid costly traps and make informed decisions
- Influencers/communities: amplify credible projects with less reputational risk
- Builders: showcase healthy on-chain behavior and earn trust earlier
- Platforms/DEXs: reduce scam noise and improve overall user retention

## Example Outcome

Without Pump Guard, sophisticated rug/farming bots can scale a token to multi‑million market caps, ride social momentum, and then nuke liquidity to zero.\
With Pump Guard, these patterns become visible early, enabling users to reduce exposure and route attention to authentic projects.
